This code was for a project I did to quickly create a wordpress site with over 300 pages of content. I extracted the list of websites from https://stripe.com/docs/integrations. Then for each website I used the Watson Alchemy API to pull the text from their website. I also used the Clearbit API to pull each companies logo. With all the info I then used wordpress functions to save the info as posts directly to the database and saved the logos as well in wordpress.
