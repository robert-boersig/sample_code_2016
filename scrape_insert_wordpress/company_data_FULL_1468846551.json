From then on you'll never have to think about it again. Stripe or Pin Payments transactions, refunds and fees will magically appear in your Xero account every day.\nDoes manipulating data manually drive you crazy? Us too. Ditch this painful task forever and get back to working on things that actually matter.\nWith the data Silver Siphon pulls in, Xero will automatically match invoices. Reconciling them is as easy as clicking one button. We'll even roll up fees into a single item each day to make that easier too.\nThere we were, setting up a new payment gateway for a client. The client wanted to automatically generate an invoice in Xero every time a customer was charged in Stripe. \nThat seemed easy enough. \nA trigger was created to automatically punch out the invoice whenever a new charge occurred. Great. All that was left was to create a Stripe transaction within Xero to reconcile against that invoice.\nThat's where we were halted in our tracks. Our thought process was that it had to be possible to bring the transactional data into Xero. Especially because Stripe and Xero are two of the most connected platforms out there!\nTurns out it wasn't possible at all. With a bit of research, we found a solution and created an app for the client. \nNow, Stripe transactions magically show up in her Xero account every day. Reconciling against invoices is as simple as hitting the little green OK button when Xero finds a match.\nA quick look in the forums showed that we definitely were not the only people facing this problem. So, we made Silver Siphon public. Now you can slash hours off your bookkeeping every month and have Silver Siphon do the heavy lifting.\nSince then, we have expanded to include Pin Payments, with more gateways on the way. \nWe were looking for a scalable product to integrate our Stripe billing gateway and Xero's accounting system. After researching a number of products, Silver Siphon came out far ahead of everyone else on the market - simple, reliable, scalable backed up by a team always willing to help.\nSilver Siphon has allowed me to avoid the unnecessary expense of paying for a bookkeeper. It makes reconciling Stripe transactions a cinch. Every one who uses Xero and Stripe should use it.\nXero and Stripe are both excellent but it used to be a pain to reconcile all transactions between the two. Silver Siphon has saved us around 10 hours a month and I wouldn't even say we process that many transactions. If you use Stripe and Xero this will save you way more than the cost of it!\nI tried out several other software packages linking Xero and Stripe but yours is the only one that allows me to put Stripe on my dashboard as an actual account. I\u2019m really pleased with the service so far.\nSilver Siphon is going great, everything reconciled perfectly. I'm converting into Xero from another accounting system and most other integrations I've done so far just don't seem to get things 100% correct. 97% isn't good enough because it means a whole lot of repetitive unnecessary work. Silver Siphon got it 100% right.\nSilver Siphon is super easy to set up, and even easier to use. I just have a rule set for fees, and the rest of my invoices match up to the charges exactly. Makes reconciling stripe super easy.\nLoving the Silver Siphon system, it completely streamlines my Xero accounting processes. I wish that my other payment gateways could be this easy.\nWe signed up doday. Loving the service. Making my life so much easier!

Use the URL below to\u00a0set up your Stripe + Keen IO integration.\u00a0\nFor months we\u2019ve had \u201cStripe integration\u201d on our roadmap. What data could be a better measure of success than payments?? I wanted a big revenue graph next to all of our other business metrics. I also suspect there is a large overlap between Keen IO\u00a0fans and developers who love Stripe; they\u2019d probably find the integration useful too.\nWell, last week we discovered something AWESOME! The integration is already built. Paste a\u00a0Keen IO\u00a0event collection URL into the Stripe webhooks UI and BAM, you\u2019re collecting JSON events from\u00a0Stripe.\u00a0This is what happens when companies build APIs using common design standards like ReST.\u00a0\nAnyway, the video shows how to setup the Stripe integration and make a revenue chart you can embed into your website. The Keen IO URL you need to paste into Stripe looks like this:\nhttps:\/\/api.keen.io\/3.0\/projects\/<keen_project_id>\/events\/Stripe_Events?api_key=<write_key>\nEnjoy!!\nNotes:\n1. The default integration is functional, but it isn\u2019t perfect\u00a0so we will probably release an endpoint in the future to better organize the stripe events.\n2. If you want to display your revenue in dollars instead of cents, you can divide the result by 100 and add a $ prior to calling the draw method in the Keen IO javascript library.

Many still prefer to use a comprehensive business intelligence platform. We offer many suggestions for ways to access your data on our integrations page.\nMost RJMetrics integrations begin syncing historical data as soon as they are added. Typically, the free trial period is more than enough time to sync all historical data. As a result, you will be able to sync all of your historical data without charge. For many of our clients, this adds up to billions of rows.\nWe made some of our most popular integrations available on the free plan. This means that all users, regardless of whether they are currently paying to use Pipeline, can sync data using these integrations. Paid integrations are only available to users who have selected a paid plan or who are currently in the free trial period.\nFor many of our integrations, you will be able to specifically select which data you want to bring into your data warehouse.\nMany of our clients choose to sync newly updated data every thirty minutes, so that they always have access to the freshest information. But we can sync your data at other intervals or even once per day if you prefer. The frequency of your data sync will impact the number of rows you sync per month.\nAll users have access to online support at our help center. This help center has answers to the most common questions about how to use Pipeline. In addition, we offer Chat Support for all users. You will be able to access Chat Support after you sign in. We do our best to respond within about 15 minutes during business hours (9am - 6pm Eastern Time).\nWe offer phone support options for Enterprise clients. Information about our support can be found in our Terms of Service.\nWe offer a 14-day free trial of our Enterprise plan, no credit card required. During this time you will have access to both free and paid integrations as well as be able to sync unlimited rows to your data warehouse. At the end of the 14 days, you can switch to our Free plan or choose a paid plan. If you select a Free plan, any paid integrations you have set up will be paused at that time, but the data will remain in your data warehouse. At any point you can select a paid plan to continue using your paid integrations.\nMonthly subscriptions are paid via credit card. Annual subscriptions can be paid via check, wire transfer, or credit card.\nRJMetrics Pipeline is priced based on data volume: pricing scales with the number of events or rows being synced. Every time we sync a new or updated row from one of your data sources, this will count against your total row limit for the month. The best way to figure out what your data volume across all data sources will be is to connect all of your data sources during the free trial period, when you will be able to view a detailed breakdown of the volume of data being pushed by each data source.\nWe\u2019ve found that most of our clients choose the Starter or the Basic plan.\nWe never want you to lose access to fresh data. So instead of shutting down your data pipeline once you hit your monthly row limit, we continue syncing data for an additional fee if you are on any paid plan. We will let you know if you are nearing your monthly row limit, and you\u2019ll be able to reduce frequency of updates, pause integrations to prevent the additional charges, or upgrade your plan. We will waive charges for additional rows for any month in which you upgrade up to the number of rows included in the new plan.\nYes! You can change your plan at any time.\nWe have clients who sync billions of rows of data each month. For those clients, we have a selection of plans available, ranging from up to 1 billion rows synced per month to unlimited.

Software is great. Updates are great. Price is great. My employees think it's great. What more could you ask for.\nI love the ease of use and it has really helped. I come from a pestpac background and this is so much easier. Thank you\nI've tested several different software programs and found GorillaDesk to be the best, it's very affordable and they have great customer service.\nGorillaDesk is the best for all your pest control needs. We tried 3 different ones. GD takes the place of another person in the office. The day it goes I go!! Seriously\nGreat program has saved us a bunch of time. Customer support is very helpful in getting us the things we need to stay productive. Looking forward to the future improvements and innovations that continue to make this product one of the best management programs on the market today.\nUsed PestPac before and they stink. Since switching to GorillaDesk my headaches are gone. It's so easy to use and very affordable. It grows with my business and does exactly what I need it to do.\nI used Qexpress... pestpac... even pest routes. Nothing comes close to GorillaDesk. Best on the market and getting better every week. Very powerful, and user friendly. Useful on desktop PC in the office and tablet\/phone for the techs in the field... Hands down best all around program on the market.\nAbsolutely fantastic software, simple to use, love the fact we can suggest our own ideas into the software & they are heard.\nWe made the switch and absolutely love GorillaDesk! The only regret I have is that we didn't do it sooner! Thanks Shane DeRossett for great advice concerning this great company.\nHands down the most powerful tool we have in our arsenal! Intuitive to use and super responsive customer service. You and your techs will love this program. We have experienced 437% growth ytd and Gorilladesk has met or exceeded all expectations. As we have grown from a small business to medium sized business Gorilladesk has kept up milestone after milestone. A big thanks from all the folks here at Bloom Pest Control.\n GorillaDesk is a great, affordable option for my business. It is extremely user-friendly and intuitive. It also works great on tablets and smart phones for my technicians to use. My crew and I have found this scheduling software to allow our company to run more efficiently and have really benefited since switching over from a competitor.\nGorillaDesk is a no frills pest control customer database and service application program. The more you use it, the more you see that its basic design comes from the experiences of someone who actually worked in the field. Yes it is a basic system compared to some, but the reliability and execution are magnificent! The staff is great as well! Always there to take care of any questions and concerns, as well as keep their customers in the know on updates and future endeavors with the system! Much better than PestPac, Misson, RDF, and ServPro programs!\nMade it possible for a one man company to be very professional.

It's quick books, route me now & google calendar all built into one amazing program!\nI\u2019m a one-man shop. I want to keep overhead low and your monthly price point is unbeatable. I like the look, feel and intuitiveness of your app. I\u2019ve been only seriously using the software for about 2 days and I think I pretty well learned how to do everything in it that I need to do.\nHaving worked in the pest control industry for 10+ years and seeing the complications and confusion associated with some of the industry software (PestPac and Routepoint) I began searching for a user friendly alternative for my start up company. After researching and testing other options GorillaDesk was by far the best. It does everything I need and I am constantly finding more features as I use it. The price is fantastic and the support is amazing. Thank you GorillaDesk.\nI still cannot believe how easy this software is .. I hired an employee last week, and she was able to work in GorillaDesk by herself, the first day.\nThanks for offering such an affordable software. There is a lot of value and it\u2019s really powerful. Keep up the good work.\nThis software is the total package. From scheduling to customizable invoicing to routing. This program was well thought out by someone who knows the service business. I use it to run my small pest control company in Miami with 3 technicians. If I ever have any issues I simply call the owner of the company and he walks me through what to do over the phone. That's great customer service! If you're currently using a different software, give the 14 day free trial a go. It'll sell itself.\nA+ choice for anyone looking for a simple all-in-one solution. You can tell they really focused on making the user interface simple and easy. It\u2019s the best design I\u2019ve tried for a pest control software of this type.\nJust started using Gorilla Desk this week and love it. I was only using quick books before.\nI just wanted to say thank you for such a great product. With 20 years in pest control this is by far the best program and most intuitive I've used. Keep up the good work and I will continue to tell everyone I know in the industry about you!\nI tried a dozen different programs before I found GorillaDesk and none of them offered the same level of functionality and ease of use as GorillaDesk does! It saves hours of time every week and the workflow couldn\u2019t be easier. Nothing better for a start up small business or a one man operation. GorillaDesk is the real deal and its extensive capabilities will make a small business feel every bit as powerful as a large company.\nAfter using PestPac for years and becoming increasingly disgruntled with their system, service, and pricing, we decided to look around and trial other different pest control \/ service business software packages that worked better at better value. Once we stumbled through a few unsuccessfully that couldn't do everything we needed, we found GorillaDesk. Not only is the scheduling function of this software infinitely easier and more intuitive than what we were using before, but the invoicing, emailing, and reporting systems in GorillaDesk are all packaged together and becoming more robust every day. We handle everything through GorillaDesk now, including multiple touch points for follow up or marketing initiatives to our clients, using the easy to use email system integrated right in to the software. It's also very easy to scale up as our company continues to grow with more routes and technicians. Not to mention, it's very easy to train new people to use the system, saving us lots of time and heartache. Nothing but great things to say about GorillaDesk and the support team! Thanks a million!!\nI wanted to send you a message to let you know that last night I was extremely happy! I received a call from both of my guys and I was told that they love the program and were very happy with it! I was with PestaRoo from January of this year until I came on with you and they NEVER said they liked the other program in fact it was a DAILY complaint from one or the other! I tell you it was driving all of us crazy! So I wanted to say THANK YOU for helping me and my techs and my business!\nI wanted to express again how much we enjoy using GorillaDesk. It has been very friendly to operate and has drastically cut down our office and technician paperwork workload. We are excited to hear about new features as you continue to roll them out!\nFirst off i want to say that I'm impressed with GorillaDesk. Everyone that told me to use it was right. It's so easy to navigate around in. My only regret is not using it when I first opened. The decision for us was easy. GorillaDesk has made my business so much better and easier to handle.\nI have been using gorilla desk for about a year now and I'm very happy with it. I was trying to manage 500 customers on Excel and missing stops because of it. Its only $49 per month for 1 route, and can send out automated scheduling emails and invoices, even to sms. I have previously worked for orkin, terminix, massey, and home team, and looked into pest pac, and gorilladesk is by far superior to anything I have previously used.\nGorilla Desk has made my life in the office so much better. It is easy to use, very friendly. Nothing is hard about it yet it does everything it needs to for it to be efficient. In fact, it is so much better than the other software that we have used in the past, I have been able to do everything myself and not have to hire another employee due to the fact that Gorilla is so efficient. I can't say enough about it, really. I love it!!!\nWhat a great difference this GorillaDesk has made for our company. In just a month we are so much more organized! The owner and I have found that we can communicate in real time and take more clients because we can transfer information to each other so quickly. Our paperwork has been diminished and when it used to take me hours to input all the client information and updates after each day, now takes me minutes! Thank you so much.\nI started GorillaDesk about 3 weeks ago and I wish I had used it from the beginning. It is very simple to master and keeps up with my sales per customer, per week, month, event items such as weed control, fire ants etc. And I'm sure there are other features that I have yet to find. I am a one man business at the moment who works two other jobs and it's not hard for me to keep up with the software.\nThank you for continuing to listen and more than that taking action. The response and willingness of your team is exactly what we're looking for in a software partner.\nI just wanted you to know that I have been using the system for a couple of months now, and I really like it. I chose it and your team over 8 other systems that I looked at, and I'm really glad I did. The system is clear and easy, and it's fun watching you make it better and better. Thanks for making such an intuitive program and continuing to make it better.\nGorillaDesk is simple, easy to learn and use. Saving time is #1 for small business owners and this software platform does exactly that. My morning routine is well\u2026 no longer a routine. No more hand written scheduling, bulk invoice printing, creating schedule materials for techs\u2026 simply put, far less clutter. I can see my desk again.\nI tried a ton of programs over the last year... ZoHo, Fieldwork, PestPac and Jobber. This was a long journey on an attempt to find the perfect pest program that fit my business needs. GorillaDesk won hands down. I commend the dedication the GorillaDesk team puts forth to their customers.\nI just want to say how much I have enjoyed using GorillaDesk. I have tried and used about every software out there. I even used a DOS version of PestPac from back in the day. But from the first day of the trial version I knew this was going to work for me. It is easy to figure out and start using right away. The team goes way beyond in customer service. I have had great responses from my customers about email reminders and billing. It's really cool to see that the customers have confirmed appointments from emails. I can't wait to see what's in store for the future of GorillaDesk.\nI love how GorillaDesk caters to solo technicians and it is also very affordable. I've been using it for over a year.\nNo one person or company can touch GorillaDesk. Their price, ability and readiness to update and add new features is outstanding. The most amazing part about this software is the customer service. We have had issues at all hours of the day\/night and have received the fastest responses we could have ever imagined of getting. We will be lifetime clients and will refer this program to everyone we know.\nStumbled across Gorilladesk after trying every generic and industry pest control software available. The functionality, ease of use and clean interface is exactly what we were looking for and our production flow and scheduling has never been more organized until now.\nWe really love GorillaDesk. You did a great job, best pest program out there! Believe me we tried countless pest programs. GD is by far the best & most intuitive.\nI\u2019ve just started using your pest control software and I love it. It\u2019s easy to use and to the point. Saves me a ton of time!!!\n"},{"cat_clean":"Booking & Ticketing","cat_raw":"Booking &amp; Ticketing","cat_id":"5","url":"https:\/\/innstyle.co.uk\/","name":"Inn Style","desc":"Inn Style is a slick and simple booking system for all kinds of accommodation owners.","text":"Whether you\u00a0run\u00a0a Bed & Breakfast, Small Hotel, Campsite\/Glampsite, Holiday Cottage or a Tourism Organisation, Inn Style will help you sell more online, easily.\nInn Style is the\u00a0clear and useful booking system\u00a0you need to take online bookings, manage your diary, distribute your availability and process payments online.\n            Try Inn Style now for free   \u00a0      \n        Use Inn Style risk-free for 14 days.

For the dry cleaner, the ability to check in an order from a cell phone, receive payment before delivery and check day-to-day analytics on the go has been fantastic.\nFar and away the best dry cleaning software solution out there.

You can start your own online store for less than a dollar a day, with no hidden extra fees such as Apps for providing shipping calculations,  or bandwidth charges. \nWe decided all our Spiffy Store owners deserve an early Christmas present, so we\u2019ve rolled out a rather fab update to the Toolbox a little earlier than we\u2019d previously planned.\nWe\u2019ve been working on this for some time, but as it\u2019s mostly an upgrade to our infrastructure code behind the Toolbox, we don\u2019t think you\u2019ll notice much of a change. However, the huge benefits for everyone are clear to see. We\u2019ve positioned our code so that it\u2019s far easier to upgrade and to extend, so you\u2019ll see a more consistent interface, and we\u2019ll be able to deliver new features at a faster rate.\nTo set up a store, you just need to choose plan below, and complete the signup form. You will then be asked to verify your email address before your store is set up. \nSpiffy Stores is fully integrated with PayPal, which is the easiest way to accept payments. We also integrate with over 60 different payment gateways. A full list of all of the payment gateways we support is available in our knowledge base.\nUnlike most online store builders, Spiffy Stores are created instantly - as soon as you complete the signup form. You can then start customising the look of your store by adding your logo, adding your products, creating collections (or categories) for your products, and then adding them to your menus.\nSpiffy Stores was created by online specialists Shawn Finlay and Brian Kenn. Together, Shawn (the creative one) and Brian (the technical one) have many years of experience working on web solutions for clients such as Time Warner, Rip Curl, Toyota, Toshiba, Fujitsu, PWC, ANZ Bank, Mars, Australian Stock Exchange, National Australia Bank, BankWest, Telstra and Macquarie University. \nIn 2001 we formed Spiffy Internet, which was originally conceived as a design studio providing a range of services to small businesses... including working with them to establish business plans, developing their identity and even hosting their web sites. E-commerce was then just starting up, and we had a number of clients wanting to sell online. We started working with  \"E-commerce in a box\" type solutions, but soon found they they were difficult to customise for Australian businesses, and also  that many of them were bloated, resource-hungry monsters that were difficult to use and set up. \nIn 2004, we began building our own online store software. We had the experience with our existing customers, and the creative and technical expertise to do so. We already had several customers using the the base code, but their stores were heavily customised.\nAfter a lot of work, and a complete code re-write, we opened a Beta program in 2007 and invited a few small businesses to work with us. Their feedback was essential for us to know what's most important for a wider range of small businesses when selling on the web. We launched Spiffy Stores in early 2010, and we've grown substantially since then. Spiffy Stores is now used by hundreds of small businesses in Australia and New Zealand who have found it a safe, easy and reliable way to sell online. \nThe story doesn't end there though. We're constantly adding new features and improving the software, so if you have any suggestions for us... please let us know!\nTo find out more about Spiffy Stores, send us an email, or call 1300 727 334 and speak with Brian or Shawn directly.\n"},{"cat_clean":"E-commerce","cat_raw":"E-commerce","cat_id":"8","url":"http:\/\/www.squarespace.com\/","name":"Squarespace","desc":"Squarespace is an all-in-one platform for easily creating websites, blogs, galleries, and stores.","text":"Create a beautiful blog to share your passion with the world.

It's given you a ton of flexibility, because you can build payments into your app in whatever way you'd like, customizing it in just about any way that you can think up.\nThe problem is: You've been writing your app for weeks, or even months. You've added the code to accept payments, and you've got paying customers. But you just got a sinking feeling. What happens when you have trouble charging those customers because their charges are declined? When they cancel their card but forget to update their billing information, or have a failed payment for some other reason, how do you make sure that you keep getting paid? \nYou've worked hard to get customers, and you want to make sure that they stay customers. You don't want to lose them due to failed payments and billing issues, but you just want to get back to writing code for your app. You know that you need dunning in your app (code that sends notifications over time when billing issues arise and allows customers to update their billing information), but the thought of figuring out what webhooks to listen for, how to respond to them, and making sure it's all tested and stable is just not something that you want to deal with or worry about.\nWhat if you didn't have to worry about lost revenue due to expired cards and failed payments, and you didn't have to write a single line of code to make that a reality? Stunning makes that possible.\nWe've been dealing with failed payments on Stripe for years, and we know that our methods are highly effective. Stunning was built from the ground up to deal with failed payments, and it's our core feature. Our failed payment handling isn't just another feature that we added to make our app look more attractive. We're serious about failed payments.\nYou connect Stunning securely to your Stripe account, using Stripe Connect.\nWhen a customer triggers an event that you've set up notifications for, Stunning sends them on your behalf, and optionally notifies you as well. \nWe've been running successful web apps since 2006, and have thousands of customers of our own, spread out between multiple apps. We are serious about minimizing churn.\nWe send thousands of emails each week on behalf of our customers, and Stunning's back-end was built with nearly a decade of experience of running web apps at scale. We've been helping customers with failed payments on Stripe longer than anyone else out there. \nYou are in complete control of the contents of the emails that we send out, and you can receive a copy of every email that we send on your behalf.\nIt's in our best interest to keep Stunning working as awesomely as possible, because we use it on our own apps! Stunning uses Stunning.\nWe use Stripe Connect to securely connect to your Stripe account, meaning that with a couple of clicks you're connected, and you have full control over our access to your account.\nWe are constantly talking to our customers to see what they need, and adding features that benefit everyone.\n \t\t\t\t\t\t\tWe use Stunning to send detailed receipts, emails about credit card status, and our favorite, personalized welcome emails. I love being able to send customized emails automatically based on actions that my customers have taken. This has cut our manual workload in half! I would recommend Stunning not only because the product is great, but also because the company building it is focused on our success. They are responsive, they are smart, and they offer a great product! \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nBlakely Graham\n \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\"Aside from the great benefits that Stunning provides from a CRM and retention perspective, their customer service is extraordinary. We have some unique payment models and the Stunning team went far above and beyond to help us with proper implementation and setup. The great communication and service, as much as the great product, will keep us on board as customers for a long, long time.\" \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nGavin Thomas\n \t\t\t\t\t\t\tCustomer churn is one of the key metrics that we watch very closely here at FullContact.  Stunning allowed us to focus on building our product while quickly implementing, without any code, a solution that allows us to send receipts, cancellation, and dunning emails to our customers. \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nSome failed payments can be collected successfully if you just retry them at the right time. With Smart Retries, Stunning goes beyond Stripe's built-in retries. It intelligently retries your failed payments at times that have the best chance of recovering revenue, based on your customer base and what's best for your particular app.\nShortly before credit cards expire, Stunning attempts to automatically update the billing information for them. If it's unsuccessful, it sends a series of emails to your customers on your behalf, so that they can update their billing information before a payment fails. This keeps your cash-flow on track, because you end up with less failed payments.\nWhen a card is unable to be charged for any reason, Stunning emails your customer and lets them know what the issue is so that they can fix it and keep their subscription active. Not using Stripe's subscriptions? Stunning can still send dunning emails for you.\nHaving multiple ways to contact your customers when payments fail is essential. Stunning lets you also send SMSes to your customers when payments fail, with links that let them directly update their billing information. Don't have cell numbers for your customers? We can even help you collect them.\nWhen a card is about to expire, or a customer has a failed payment, Stunning can let them know inside of your app. In-app notifications are even more effective than emails, because your customer is already engaged with your app when they see the notification.\nStunning provides secure payment update pages that you can link to in your dunning emails, so that your users can easily update their payment info. You can also use our payment pages on your own domain, or you can link to your own!\nIf a customer is marked unpaid and they update their billing information, Stunning will reactivate their subscription and charge them for their past due payments, bringing their account up to date automatically.\nEasily send your customers fully customizable plain-text or HTML receipts each time they are charged. Use your own templates, for consistent branding.\nEasily let your customers see a list of all of their successful charges and print\/download them in PDF format.\nHave real-time notifications pushed directly into the Slack channel of your choice when customers go delinquent, when they update their billing info and are successfully charged, or when the dunning process is unsuccessful, so your team can follow up personally. \t\t\t\nConditions allow you to have specific emails sent only to customers who meet certain criteria. Combined with the ability to have multiple templates, this allows you a ton of flexibility that lets you send the right emails to the right customers at the right times.\nHave a custom email sent when a customer starts their subscription to your app.\nStunning can send different emails to your customers depending on whether their account was cancelled manually, or automatically due to billing issues.\nThese emails are sent to your customers before their trial period is over. You can use these to remind them that they are about to be charged, or to make sure that they get the full use of their trial.\nThese emails are sent to your customers as confirmation when their plan is changed. \nHave a confirmation email sent to your customers when you refund charges.\nHave a reminder email sent to your customers a week before they are charged.\nWithin your Stunning account, you can see when we send emails, who we send them to, and even when they update their payment information. We can even send you straight to Stripe for more details. \nProjector gives you a straightforward, 2 month revenue prediction for your Stripe account. Know how much you made this month, what next month will look like, and where you're losing revenue.\nMetadater keeps your Stripe customer metadata up to date.

At your stage, static email newsletters (even basic autoresponders) just aren\u2019t cutting it anymore.\nYou're hearing everywhere that marketing automation is a place to make big leaps in conversion rates; from smarter email capture to personalized lead nurturing to lead scoring to post-purchase education and retention. But the solutions you've looked at have been too complicated, time consuming, and expensive to set up.\nIf that's the case, you're going to love Drip.\n\u201cAdding the widget to my site literally took me less than 10 minutes,       and has already captured 956 leads in 3 months!

Click one of the buttons below to get an idea of how Drip customers are using marketing automation to capture more leads, onboard more users, and close more sales.\nIf this sounds familiar, it should. It's textbook marketing automation, but with one key difference.\nThe difference between Drip and other marketing automation software is that our sole purpose, nay our mission, is to make it ridiculously easy (and cost effective) to get started, and we provide you with the best email tools, guidance, campaign blueprints, and analytics that you've ever seen in this kind of tool. Hands down.\nYou\u2019ll be gathering new email subscribers less than five minutes after starting your free trial.\nThe vast majority of our competitors require you to pay them before you can even have a look at their software. That's great for them because they've placed the risk in your hands, and they're banking on you never using their tool (they get to keep your money either way).\nWe adamantly disagree with this approach so we offer a 100% free trial (you pay nothing to try us out).\nAt Drip, we believe the onus is on us to show you results. This is why, in addition to our free trial, we'll import your existing list for free (we also have an import tool built into Drip if you'd prefer to do it yourself).\nAnd we'll even create a custom 5-day email mini course at no charge if you have some existing content we can work from (such as a few blog posts or an ebook).\nWe do everything in our power to get you setup and receiving loads of value from Drip.\nSo if you want to automatically send a user a series of emails, without writing any code, based on a purchase through Gumroad or PayPal, a recurring charge in Stripe or Chargify, or a new email into Unbounce or LeadPages, you should try Drip.\nIf you want to capture leads from every page of your website by adding a single snippet of JavaScript to your footer, you should try Drip.\nIf you want to use email to inspire your target customers and earn their trust, transform skeptical users into successful customers, and turn successful customers into raving fans who bring new business straight to your door, you should try Drip.\nWe've painstakingly studied successful online businesses such as SaaS applications, software companies, Ebook authors, and consultants, and adapted their approaches into email blueprints that show you the simple (but crucial) steps that will make this work for you.\nIn essence, Drip's #1 goal is to pull you from the dark ages into email marketing enlightenment.\nAsk yourself: can your current email solution track actions your subscribers take inside your emails and on the web? Can you use automated lead scoring to pinpoint your hottest prospects? Automatically add hot leads to your favorite CRM software? Create custom subscriber lists using just about any criteria? Prune your list of inactive subscribers?\nDrip does all this, and more.\nDon't continue to fumble with a clumsy interface, or stick with email newsletter software you outgrew years ago.\nWe pride ourselves in building hand-crafted, organic software that provides you with an experience unlike any other email marketing software you've used.\nBut don\u2019t take our word for it, have a look inside and decide for yourself.\n\u201cAs a geek, I love Drip because it's lightweight, straight-forward, and       engineered by people who know how to write software.

The owner, Tom Kelly, was helping his mother look for a way to run an online charity auction for a local non profit. After searching the few online charity auction companies, he found that every company charged huge upfront fees and a large percentage fee on the money raised. With the local non profit raising an average of $3000 per auction, after the upfront cost and the huge performance fee, the non profit would be left with almost nothing.         \n           With that in mind, Tom thought he could do much better. He created a simple online charity auction software platform for the local non profit. After the success of the first auction and the fact that the non profit organization was able to keep more of the money raised, word quickly spread. Tom had more and more organizations wanting to use his site and he quickly found that his simple auction software platform was turning into a game changer.           \n           Since 2007 we have helped 4500+ of the world's top non profits and schools raise over $85 million dollars.         \n"},{"cat_clean":"Fundraising & Marketplaces","cat_raw":"Fundraising &amp; Marketplaces","cat_id":"13","url":"http:\/\/donate.ly","name":"Donately","desc":"Donately helps organizations raise more money with less effort.","text":"Raise more money with less effort.

Read more\u2026 \nPay-per-click (PPC) advertising - like Google Adwords and Facebook - are getting more expensive all the time. While we invest heavily in Google Adwords ourselves here at LeadDyno, I can tell you that our click costs are constantly creeping up. Which means that next month, I know we'll have to pay a little bit more to get the same results. Our affiliate program, on the other hand, is always profitable... because we pay our affiliates a commission based on the sales they bring us. Until they sell something, we don't have to pay them anything. Affiliate marketing is also more scalable than pay-per-click (PPC) marketing. While there are a fixed number of relevant keywords that we (and you) can bid on and make money, there's basically an unlimited amount of product that you can sell with affiliate partners.\nAs you probably know by now, most affiliate tracking software is pretty complex to get setup! You won't have any setup issues with LeadDyno. We designed it to be really easy to integrate with your website. Many of our E-Commerce integrations are \"one-click.\" For example, if you're a Shopify store owner, you simply enter the URL of your store, give LeadDyno permission to connect with it, and you're done. You simply do this once, and you're ready to start rolling out links and marketing materials to your affiliates! We also provide complimentary setup help. We're available to assist five days per week via phone, six days per week via live chat, and seven days per week via email.\nNew prospective users often ask me how easy it is for their affiliate to share their link. It's \"stupid simple.\" Here's how it works... When your affiliates sign up with you, they'll automatically receive an email from you welcoming them to your affiliate program. This email will contain their unique referral link. It will also contain a \"one-click\" login link to their Affiliate Dashboard. The Affiliate Dashboard is where your affiliate can share their link via email and social media with a single click. For example, when they click the Facebook button, they'll automatically be forwarded over to Facebook, with a new post pre-populated, and their affiliate link already embedded! They can add a personal note or recommendation if they'd like - or they can simply click \"Post\" to get the message up on their Wall immediately. This \"convenience factor\" is huge. Affiliates are able to share their link early and often with their friends and colleagues. It really couldn't be any easier. The Affiliate Dashboard is also where they can grab marketing materials like banner ads for their website or blog. The banners will already have their affiliate link embedded. So, your affiliate can simply copy the HTML and paste it to their site - or they can have their web developer do this for them.\nOne of the classic criticisms of affiliate marketing is the \"black box\" nature of it. Traditionally, if you're an affiliate, you receive a link that you are supposed to use to send traffic to someone's website. So you send visitors their way, and you \"hope\" that you're getting credit for everything! But you really have no way to know... Many affiliate programs that I participate in only send me a sales report quarterly. I usually don't even get a traffic report. This makes it difficult for me (as an affiliate) to promote their product... because I don't know what's working. I'm a creative marketer, so I always like to try different things. But without an affiliate traffic report delivered to me, I have no idea what's working... or what's not working. In a perfect world, every affiliate manager would run LeadDyno! As an affiliate with access to LeadDyno's \"critically acclaimed\" Affiliate Dashboard, I can get my traffic and sales reports in real-time. If I send a click to someone's website, I'll get to see that immediately. That level of transparency alone is very motivating. I can also see my affiliate commissions as they accrue - giving me confidence that I'm going to get paid by the site owner. And I'll get paid in timely fashion - thanks to LeadDyno's one-click affiliate payout screen that goes directly to PayPal! \nI never really knew how Google Adwords was working for me until I began tracking conversions with LeadDyno. While I always used the conversion tracking pixel that Google provides, I always found it to be imperfect. That's because I want to measure specific $$$ amounts and sales... while Google is only able to tell me if someone made it to a certain page. Like a sign up, or \"thank you\" page. That's a good start - but I need more! Specifically, I need to know what somebody bought and\/or signed up for... how much they purchased... and how long they stayed with us afterwards. This is easy to do with LeadDyno. All you need to do is create a new marketing campaign tracking link - as use this link as the Target URL within Adwords. Or, if you're advertising on Facebook, just make sure the link that you provide Facebook with is a campaign tracking link from LeadDyno. Don't just give Facebook the link to your homepage - give them this link instead. It's pretty much the same thing as using an affiliate link to track the effectiveness of a specific marketing campaign. Because LeadDyno is already plugged into your website - and most importantly, your E-Commerce provider - you'll have visibility into the entire sales funnel that was generated as a result of each specific advertising campaign you are tracking. I've been doing online marketing for the past decade, and I can tell you this is huge. It allows me to test campaigns quickly and easily. I'm able to let our winners run, and cut our losers short. \n"},{"cat_clean":"Referral Marketing","cat_raw":"Referral Marketing","cat_id":"21","url":"https:\/\/playpylon.com\/","name":"PlayPylon","desc":"PlayPylon is a fully hosted and managed affiliate network for games.","text":"PlayPylon is a new platform for desktop and mobile game marketing.\nFor both indies and studios, we offer marketing packages at a fixed price and easy to understand.\nPlayPylon bridges the gap between the most interesting developers in the field,\nand the audiences who are crying out for exciting new experiences.\nUpgrade your marketing with a fully customizable affiliate campaign \u2013 start a campaign today and start making waves!             \nCalculate my campaign offers now!\nYou get to chose exactly what scale of budget you wish to run the campaign in, and you can even define a solid CPI, making sure that you only pay scaled with actual sales.\nWe facilitate both client-based and backend-based solutions, enabling you to setup a PlayPylon campaign without needing to do a client update.\n     Our SDKs and APIs are easy to implement, and we will guide you through the process step by step.\nWe firmly believe that connection between youtubers\/streamers and the developers contain solid grounding for good marketing if done right.\nWant to get started ?
